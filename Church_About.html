			<h3 style = "padding-bottom: 20px;">Statements of our faith</h3>
			<hr/>
			<br/>
			<p><b>The Holy Scriptures</b> (2 Tim. 3:16 -17) We believe God is Triune: Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, the three in one.</p>
			<p><b>The Fall of Man</b> (Rom. 5:12) We believe that man was created in the image of God, but that by voluntary disobedience he fell from perfection.</p>
			<p><b>Basis of Salvation</b> (John 3:16; Rom. 5:8, Rom. 10:9-10) We believe that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us, signing the pardon of all who believe on Him and confess Jesus Christ as their Lord.</p>
			<p><b>Salvation Through Grace</b> (Eph. 2:8) We believe that before salvation we have no righteousness of our own and must come to God through the righteousness of Christ.</p>
			<p><b>Repentance and Acceptance</b> (I John 1:9) We believe that upon sincere repentance and a wholehearted acceptance of Christ as Lord, we are justified before God.</p>
			<p><b>The New Birth</b> (Cor. 5:17; Gal. 2:20; John 3:5-7) We believe that the change which takes place in the heart and life at conversion is a literal one and is the result of being born of the Spirit of God.</p>
			<p><b>Daily Christian Life</b> (Heb. 6:1) We believe that it is the will of God that we live a sanctified and holy life, growing constantly in the Faith.</p>
			<p><b>Water Baptism</b> (Matt. 28:19) We believe that baptism by immersion, in water, is an outward sign of the inward work of salvation.</p>
			<p><b>The Lord’s Supper</b> (I Cor. 11:28) We believe in the commemoration of the Lord’s Supper by the symbolical use of the bread and the juice of the vine.</p>
			<p><b>Baptism of the Holy Spirit</b> (Acts 1:8; Acts 2:4) We believe that the Baptism of the Holy Spirit is to endue the believer with power, and that His empowering is after the same manner as in the Bible days.</p>
			<p><b>The Spirit-Filled Life</b> (Eph. 4:30-32) We believe that it is the will of God that we walk in the Spirit continually.</p>
			<p><b>The Gifts and the Fruit of the Spirit</b> (I Cor. 12:1-11; Gal. 5:22-23; Rom 12:6-8, Eph. 4:11-13) We believe that the Holy Spirit has gifts to bestow upon the Christian and that we should show spiritual fruit as evidence of a Spirit-filled life.</p>
			<p><b>Moderation and Balance</b> (Phil. 4:5) We believe that all truth must be balanced with other scriptural truth in order to avoid any extreme or fanaticism, and we believe that moderation should show forth in our daily walk as a believer.</p>
			<p><b>Divine Healing</b> (I Peter 2:24; Matt. 8:17; Matt 18:18-19; James 5:14-16; I Cor. 2:9; Mark 16:15-18; Matt. 24:25; Mark 13:31; Luke 21:33) We believe that divine healing is the provision of Christ to heal the sick in response to the exercise of faith, the prayer of faith, the prayer of agreement, anointing with oil, the gifts of healing or the laying on of hands. We believe that this provision of Christ is for everyone today.</p>
			<p><b>The Second Coming</b> (I Thes. 4:16-17) We believe that the second coming of Christ is literal and inevitable.</p>
			<p><b>Church Membership</b> (Acts 16:5; Heb. 10:5) We believe it is our sacred duty to identify and actively participate with the local and visible church of Christ.</p>
			<p><b>Civil Government</b> (Rom. 13:1-5) We believe that the laws of the land should be upheld at all times except in matters opposed to the Word of God.</p>
			<p><b>The Final Judgment</b> (2 Cor. 5:10; Rev. 20:11-13) We believe that all shall stand one day before God in final judgment, and there receive eternal reward or eternal judgment.</p>
			<p><b>Heaven</b> (John 14:2; Rev. 7:15-17) We believe that Heaven is a literal place, eternally existent.</p>
			<p><b>Hell</b> (Rev. 20:10, Rev. 20:15) We believe that hell is a literal place of eternal torment for all who reject the Lord Jesus.</p>
			<p><b>Evangelism</b> (James 5:20; Mark 16:15; 2 Cor. 5:18-21) We believe that soul-winning is the Great Commission given to the Church.</p>
